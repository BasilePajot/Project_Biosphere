This directory contains everything that you need to do a GWAS of the data you had from the blasted data.

First, the "comparative blasting method" file is used to compare the Ncbi, Bold and Arthemis results on the different databases and make comparative databases. 

Then, the "Analyse_of_the_insect_database" file is used to use the transformed table from the previous file to make a Gwas with the data. The input of this file 
must be a table with just one sceintific name and the justification of why this name. Contact me and I will be able to give you a preview of what the data is 
supposed to look like. To be used.
